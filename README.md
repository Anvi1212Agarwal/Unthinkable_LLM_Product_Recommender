# Unthinkable_LLM_Product_Recommender
An intelligent E-commerce Product Recommender built using Python and Streamlit.
This app suggests relevant products to users based on their activity and also uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to explain “Why this product?” in simple, human-like language.

Everything runs from a single file — app.py, making it super easy to use and deploy.
